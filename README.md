install the latest version of groovyscript from curseforge and put it in the mods folder. if your pack doesn't have mixinbooter already installed, you would have to install that too. Launch the game to allow groovy to be installed. After that, check that your instance has the 'groovy' folder, and that within that folder there are 2 more called 'preInit' and 'postInit'. PreInit scripts are basically scripts that load at an early stage, its where you register items and materials. PostInit is where you would register recipes.
