install the latest version of groovyscript from curseforge and put it in the mods folder. if your pack doesn't have mixinbooter already installed, you would have to install that too. Launch the game to allow groovy to be installed. After that, check that your instance has the `groovy` folder, and that within that folder there are 3 more called `'preInit', 'postInit'`. If they're not there create them.
Download the folder `groovy_breakingbadnfu/classes` and put it into the `groovy` folder. `BBMaterials.groovy` go into `preInit` folder. `BBRecipes.groovy` go into `postInit` folder
