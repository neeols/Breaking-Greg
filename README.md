install the latest version of groovyscript from curseforge and put it in the mods folder. if your pack doesn't have mixinbooter already installed, you would have to install that too. Launch the game to allow groovy to be installed. After that, check that your instance has the `'groovy'` folder and replace your `'runConfig.json'` with the one provided. Then, check that within the `'groovy'` folder there are 3 more folders called `'preInit', 'postInit', 'classes'`. If they're not there create them.
Download the contents of the `'classes'` folder and put it into the folder you created. `'BBMaterials.groovy', 'BBItems.groovy'` go into `'preInit'` folder. `'BBRecipes.groovy'` go into `'postInit'` folder.
